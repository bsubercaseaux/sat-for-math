## Tutorials

A series of hands-on tutorials for SAT-solving towards combinatorial problems is available at [https://bsubercaseaux.github.io/tutorials/](https://bsubercaseaux.github.io/tutorials/). Those tutorials were co-authored by Bernardo Subercaseaux and Marijn Heule.

A book with plenty of examples, both for SAT and SMT solving, is available at [https://smt.st/](https://smt.st/), thanks to Dennis Yurichev.

## Workshops

- **Simons + SLMath**: [AI For Math and TCS](https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/simons-institute-theory-computing-slmath-joint-workshop-ai-mathematics-theoretical), April 2025.
