## About

The goal of this project is to centralize resources and references about the use of SAT (satsifiability) solvers in mathematics (broadly understood).

It is a spin-off of the great project for the area of *Algorithms with Predictions* that is led and managed by [Alexander Lindermayr](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/cslog/team/alexander-lindermayr) and [Nicole Megow](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/cslog/nmegow), who kindly allowed us to fork their code.

This website is managed by [Bernardo Subercaseaux](https://bsubercaseaux.github.io/).
<!-- The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on
 Algorithms with Predictions and to curate links to further relevant materials. This resource is intended to help new researchers quickly orient themselves in the field while also serving as a valuable reference for the broader research community to organize and cluster the rapidly growing body of results and publications in this area.  -->

<!-- It is an [open source initiative](https://github.com/algorithms-with-predictions/algorithms-with-predictions.github.io), and contributions from the community are highly encouraged, such as submitting references or links, suggesting improvements to presentation and organization, or sharing ideas for enhancing the platform. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don’t hesitate to reach out directly to [Alexander and Nicole](mailto:alps-web@uni-bremen.de).
