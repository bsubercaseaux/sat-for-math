## About

The idea of this project is to maintain an overview over the current state of research on Algorithms with Predictions and collect links to further relevant material. This should especially help new researchers in this field to orient faster, but we also try to keep track over and cluster the large amount of results and publications in this field.

This project has been set up by [Alexander Lindermayr](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/cslog/team/alexander-lindermayr) and [Nicole Megow](https://www.uni-bremen.de/en/cslog/nmegow). It is an [open source project](https://github.com/algorithms-with-predictions/algorithms-with-predictions.github.io) and everybody is very welcome to contribute. For further questions, feel free to [reach out to us](mailto:alps-web@uni-bremen.de).

List of further contributors: [Bertrand Simon](https://cclab.pages.in2p3.fr/bertrand.simon/), [Adam Polak](https://adampolak.github.io/), [Niklas Hahn](https://webia.lip6.fr/~nhahn/index.html), [Christoph DÃ¼rr](https://webia.lip6.fr/~durrc/)
