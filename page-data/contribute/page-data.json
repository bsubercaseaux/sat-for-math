The idea is to have soon a pull-request system for contributions, or some other public way to contribute.</p>\n<!-- \nThe sources and data for this webpage are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/algorithms-with-predictions/algorithms-with-predictions.github.io).\nIt uses [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) for static site rendering and is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).\n\nEveryone is very welcome to contribute:\n\n- Maintain paper references, e.g. adding, updating and labeling references (see `papers/` directory and syntax below)\n- Add and edit further material. This page is generated from the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file `src/markdown-pages/material.md` and is thus easy to modify.\n- Improve layout or design, add new features.\n\nMost contributions can be done via Pull Requests directly in the repository. For more involved suggestions or discussions, feel free to contact us ([alps-web@uni-bremen.de](mailto:alps-web@uni-bremen.de)).\n\n## Adding and Editing Paper References\n\nPaper entries are based on YAML files, which are located in the directory `papers/`.\n\nAs an example, this is the data file for the caching paper by Lykouris and Vassilvitskii (`LykourisV18competitive.yml`):\n\n```yml\ntitle: Competitive Caching with Machine Learned Advice\nauthors: Lykouris, Vassilvitskii\npublications:\n  - name: ICML\n    year: 2018\n    url: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/lykouris18a/lykouris18a.pdf\n  - name: arXiv\n    year: 2018\n    month: 1 # optional\n    day: 4 # optional\n    url: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.05399.pdf\n  - name: J. ACM\n    year: 2021\n    url: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3447579\nlabels: \n  - online\n  - caching/paging \n```\n\nIf you want to add or change the entry of a paper, you can either add/edit the file via a Pull Request or send us the file via [e-mail](mailto:alps-web@uni-bremen.de). In case you want to add a paper, please try to find a unique filename (as in the example above; but there are no strict conventions).\n\n## Automated Publication Fetching\n\nIt is also possible to only add the title and labels of a paper:\n\n```yml\ntitle: Competitive Caching with Machine Learned Advice\nlabels: \n  - online\n  - caching/paging \n```\n\nWe use an [automated procedure](https://github.com/algorithms-with-predictions/algorithms-with-predictions.github.io/blob/main/scripts/updateData.mjs) to fetch the authors last names and all publications which have an (almost) matching title from [DBLP](https://dblp.org) and [arXiv](https://arxiv.org). In this example, all three publications of this paper can be added automatically.\n\n## Local Development\n\nYou can start a local development instance of this webpage as follows:\n\nFirst, clone [this  repository](https://github.com/algorithms-with-predictions/algorithms-with-predictions.github.io) and install dependencies via a node package manager, e.g. [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):\n\n```bash\nyarn\n```\n\nThen, install the gatsby command line interface\n\n```bash\nyarn global add gatsby-cli\n```\n\nand finally run\n\n```bash\nyarn develop\n``` -->","frontmatter":{"slug":"/contribute","title":"How to Contribute"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/contribute","title":"How to Contribute"}},"staticQueryHashes":[],"slicesMap":{}}
