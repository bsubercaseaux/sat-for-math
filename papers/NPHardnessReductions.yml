    \ problem, i.e. the decision problem whether a partial structure can be completed\
    \ to a full structure, is NP-complete for many combinatorial structures. While\
    \ the gadgets for most reductions in literature are found by hand, we present\
    \ an algorithm to construct gadgets in a fully automated way. Using our framework\
    \ which is based on SAT, we present the first thorough study of the completion\
    \ problem on sign mappings with forbidden substructures by classifying thousands\
    \ of structures for which the completion problem is NP-complete. Our list in particular\
    \ includes interior triple systems, which were introduced by Knuth towards an\
    \ axiomatization of planar point configurations. Last but not least, we give an\
    \ infinite family of structures generalizing interior triple system to higher\
    \ dimensions for which the completion problem is NP-complete.},\n  archiveprefix\
