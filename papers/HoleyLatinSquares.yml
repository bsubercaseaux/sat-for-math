In this paper, we investigate the existence of HLSs satisfying the seven kinds of identities with automated reasoning techniques. We formulate this problem as propositional logic formulae. Since state-of-the-art SAT solvers have difficulty solving many HLS problems, we further propose a symmetry breaking method, called partially ordered HLS (POHLS), to eliminate isomorphic solutions. We have achieved the following goals through experimental evaluation. First, we have solved a dozen of open problems interested by mathematicians. Second, we identify the impact of different encodings. Third, we demonstrate the advantages of SAT solver over other FOL-based solvers. Fourth, we show that the proposed POHLS reduction can improve the efficiency of solving and find the complementarity between two types of symmetry breaking techniques.},\n  isbn = {978-981-9970-22-3},\n  langid = {english},\n  keywords = {Combinatorial designs,Holey Latin square,Symmetry breaking},\n  file = {/Users/bsuberca/Zotero/storage/W5RF6MBD/Liu et al. - 2024 - Investigating the\_Existence of\_Holey Latin Squares.pdf}\n}\n"
