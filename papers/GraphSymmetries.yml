    \  abstract = {There are many complex combinatorial problems which involve searching\
    \ for an undirected graph satisfying a certain property. These problems are often\
    \ highly challenging because of the large number of isomorphic representations\
    \ of a possible solution. In this paper we introduce novel, effective and compact,\
    \ symmetry breaking constraints for undirected graph search. While incomplete,\
    \ these prove highly beneficial in pruning the search for a graph. We illustrate\
    \ the application of symmetry breaking in graph representation to resolve several\
    \ open instances in extremal graph theory.},\n  isbn = {978-1-57735-633-2}\n}\n"
