      abstract = {We consider three graphs, \$\$G\_\{7,3\}\$\$, \$\$G\_\{7,4\}\$\$, and \$\$G\_\{7,6\}\$\$, related to Keller's conjecture in dimension 7. The conjecture is false for this dimension if and only if at least one of the graphs contains a clique of size \$\$2{\textasciicircum}7 = 128\$\$. We present an automated method to solve this conjecture by encoding the existence of such a clique as a propositional formula. We apply satisfiability solving combined with symmetry-breaking techniques to determine that no such clique exists. This result implies that every unit cube tiling of \$\${\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\}{\textasciicircum}7\$\$contains a facesharing pair of cubes. Since a faceshare-free unit cube tiling of \$\${\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\}{\textasciicircum}8\$\$exists (which we also verify), this completely resolves Keller's conjecture.},
