    \  abstract = {Boolean circuits is arguably the most natural model for computing\
    \ Boolean functions. Despite intensive research, for many functions, we still\
    \ do not know what optimal circuits look like. In this paper, we discuss how SAT-solvers\
    \ can be used for constructing optimal circuits for functions on moderate number\
    \ of variables. We first discuss why this problem is important and then indicate\
    \ the current frontiers: what can and cannot be found by state-of-the-art SAT-solvers,\
    \ and for what functions we are interested in finding efficient circuits.},\n\
