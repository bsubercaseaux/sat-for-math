    \ {In 1926, Levi showed that, for every pseudoline arrangement \\${\\textbackslash}mathcal\\\
    {A\\}\\$ and two points in the plane, \\${\\textbackslash}mathcal\\{A\\}\\$ can\
    \ be extended by a pseudoline which contains the two prescribed points. Later\
    \ extendability was studied for arrangements of pseudohyperplanes in higher dimensions.\
    \ While the extendability of an arrangement of proper hyperplanes in \\${\\textbackslash}mathbb\\\
    {R\\}{\\textasciicircum}d\\$ with a hyperplane containing \\$d\\$ prescribed points\
    \ is trivial, Richter-Gebert found an arrangement of pseudoplanes in \\${\\textbackslash}mathbb\\\
    {R\\}{\\textasciicircum}3\\$ which cannot be extended with a pseudoplane containing\
    \ two particular prescribed points. In this article, we investigate the extendability\
    \ of signotopes, which are a combinatorial structure encoding a rich subclass\
    \ of pseudohyperplane arrangements. Our main result is that signotopes of odd\
    \ rank are extendable in the sense that for two prescribed crossing points we\
    \ can add an element containing them. Moreover, we conjecture that in all even\
    \ ranks \\$r {\\textbackslash}geq 4\\$ there exist signotopes which are not extendable\
    \ for two prescribed points. Our conjecture is supported by examples in ranks\
    \ 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 that were found with a SAT based approach.},\n  archiveprefix\
