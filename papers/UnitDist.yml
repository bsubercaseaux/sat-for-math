    \ {We present a new method for reducing the size of graphs with a given property.\
    \ Our method, which is based on clausal proof minimization, allowed us to compute\
    \ several 553-vertex unit-distance graphs with chromatic number 5, while the smallest\
    \ published unit-distance graph with chromatic number 5 has 1581 vertices. The\
    \ latter graph was constructed by Aubrey de Grey to show that the chromatic number\
    \ of the plane is at least 5. The lack of a 4-coloring of our graphs is due to\
    \ a clear pattern enforced on some vertices. Also, our graphs can be mechanically\
    \ validated in a second, which suggests that the pattern is based on a reasonably\
    \ short argument.},\n  archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n  keywords = {Mathematics - Combinatorics},\n\
