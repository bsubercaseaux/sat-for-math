      abstract = {In 1984, Peter Winkler conjectured that every simple Venn diagram with \$n\$ curves can be extended to a simple Venn diagram with \$n+1\$ curves. We present a counterexample to his conjecture for \$n=7\$, which is obtained by combining theoretical ideas with computer assistance from state-of-the-art SAT solvers.},
