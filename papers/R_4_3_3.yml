      abstract = {The number R(4, 3, 3) is often presented as the unknown Ramsey number with the best chances of being found ``soon''. Yet, its precise value has remained unknown for almost 50 years. This paper presents a methodology based on abstraction and symmetry breaking that applies to solve hard graph edge-coloring problems. The utility of this methodology is demonstrated by using it to compute the value R(4, 3, 3) = 30. Along the way it is required to first compute the previously unknown set \${\textbackslash}mathcal \{R\}(3,3,3;13)\$consisting of 78,892 Ramsey colorings.},
