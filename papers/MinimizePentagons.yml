    \  address = {Cham},\n  abstract = {We present a comprehensive demonstration of\
    \ how automated reasoning can assist mathematical research, both in the discovery\
    \ of conjectures and in their verification. Our focus is a discrete geometry problem:\
    \ What is \\$\\${\\textbackslash}mu \\_\\{5\\}(n)\\$\\${$\\mu$}5(n), the minimum\
    \ number of convex pentagons induced by n points in the plane? In the first stage\
    \ toward tackling this problem, automated reasoning tools guide discovery and\
    \ conjectures: we use SAT-based tools to find abstract configurations of points\
    \ that would induce few pentagons. Afterward, we use Operations Research tools\
    \ to find and visualize realizations of these configurations in the plane, if\
    \ they exist. Mathematical thought and intuition are still vital parts of the\
    \ process for turning the obtained visualizations into general constructions.\
    \ A surprisingly simple upper bound follows from our constructions: \\$\\${\\\
    textbackslash}mu \\_\\{5\\}(n) {\\textbackslash}le {\\textbackslash}left( \\{{\\\
    textbackslash}begin\\{array\\}\\{c\\}{\\textbackslash}lfloor n/2 {\\textbackslash}rfloor\
    \ {\\textbackslash}{\\textbackslash} 5{\\textbackslash}end\\{array\\}\\}{\\textbackslash}right)\
    \ + {\\textbackslash}left( \\{{\\textbackslash}begin\\{array\\}\\{c\\}{\\textbackslash}lceil\
    \ n/2 {\\textbackslash}rceil {\\textbackslash}{\\textbackslash} 5{\\textbackslash}end\\\
    {array\\}\\}{\\textbackslash}right) \\$\\${$\\mu$}5(n){$\\leq\\lfloor$}n/2{$\\\
    rfloor$}5+{$\\lceil$}n/2{$\\rceil$}5, and we conjecture it is optimal. In the\
    \ second stage, we turn our focus to verifying this conjecture. Using MaxSAT,\
    \ we confirm that \\$\\${\\textbackslash}mu \\_5(n)\\$\\${$\\mu$}5(n)matches the\
    \ conjectured values for \\$\\$n {\\textbackslash}le 16\\$\\$n{$\\leq$}16, thereby\
    \ improving both the existing lower and upper bounds for \\$\\$n {\\textbackslash}in\
    \ [12, 16]\\$\\$n{$\\in$}[12,16]. Our MaxSAT results rely on two mathematical\
    \ theorems with pen-and-paper proofs, highlighting once again the rich interplay\
    \ between automated and traditional mathematics.},\n  isbn = {978-3-031-66997-2}\n\
