    \  abstract = {In this paper we bring together the areas of combinatorics and\
    \ propositional satisfiability. Many combinatorial theorems establish, often constructively,\
    \ the existence of positive integer functions, without actually providing their\
    \ closed algebraic form or tight lower and upper bounds. The area of Ramsey theory\
    \ is especially rich in such results. Using the problem of computing van der Waerden\
    \ numbers as an example, we show that these problems can be represented by parameterized\
    \ propositional theories in such a way that decisions concerning their satisfiability\
    \ determine the numbers (function) in question. We show that by using general-purpose\
    \ complete and local-search techniques for testing propositional satisfiability,\
    \ this approach becomes effective --- competitive with specialized approaches.\
    \ By following it, we were able to obtain several new results pertaining to the\
    \ problem of computing van der Waerden numbers. We also note that due to their\
    \ properties, especially their structural simplicity and computational hardness,\
    \ propositional theories that arise in this research can be of use in development,\
    \ testing and benchmarking of SAT solvers.},\n  isbn = {978-3-540-24605-3},\n\
