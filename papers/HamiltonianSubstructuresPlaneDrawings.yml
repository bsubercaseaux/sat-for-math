    \ simple drawing of a complete graph \\$K\\_n\\$ contains a plane, i.e., non-crossing,\
    \ Hamiltonian cycle. The conjecture is far from being resolved. The lower bounds\
    \ for plane paths and plane matchings have recently been raised to \\$({\\textbackslash}log\
    \ n){\\textasciicircum}\\{1-o(1)\\}\\$ and \\${\\textbackslash}Omega({\\textbackslash}sqrt\\\
    {n\\})\\$, respectively. We develop a SAT framework which allows the study of\
    \ simple drawings of \\$K\\_n\\$. Based on the computational data we conjecture\
    \ that every simple drawing of \\$K\\_n\\$ contains a plane Hamiltonian subgraph\
    \ with \\$2n-3\\$ edges. We prove this strengthening of Rafla's conjecture for\
    \ convex drawings, a rich subclass of simple drawings. Our computer experiments\
    \ also led to other new challenging conjectures regarding plane substructures\
    \ in simple drawings of complete graphs.},\n  archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n  keywords\
