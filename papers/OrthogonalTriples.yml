    \ pair of \\$10{\\textbackslash}times10\\$ Latin squares in 1959, an orthogonal\
    \ triple of \\$10{\\textbackslash}times10\\$ Latin squares has been one of the\
    \ most sought-after combinatorial designs. Despite extensive work, the existence\
    \ of such an orthogonal triple remains an open problem, though some negative results\
    \ are known. In 1999, W. Myrvold derived some highly restrictive constraints in\
    \ the special case in which one of the Latin squares in the triple contains a\
    \ \\$4{\\textbackslash}times4\\$ Latin subsquare. In particular, Myrvold showed\
    \ there were twenty-eight possible cases for an orthogonal pair in such a triple,\
    \ twenty of which were removed from consideration. We implement a computational\
    \ approach that quickly verifies all of Myrvold's nonexistence results and in\
    \ the remaining eight cases finds explicit examples of orthogonal pairs -- thus\
    \ explaining for the first time why Myrvold's approach left eight cases unsolved.\
    \ As a consequence, the eight remaining cases cannot be removed by a strategy\
    \ of focusing on the existence of an orthogonal pair; the third square in the\
    \ triple must necessarily be considered as well. Our approach uses a Boolean satisfiability\
    \ (SAT) solver to derive the nonexistence of twenty of the orthogonal pair types\
    \ and find explicit examples of orthogonal pairs in the eight remaining cases.\
    \ To reduce the existence problem into Boolean logic we use a duality between\
    \ the concepts of transversal representation and orthogonal pair and we provide\
    \ a formulation of this duality in terms of a composition operation on Latin squares.\
    \ Using our SAT encoding, we find transversal representations (and equivalently\
    \ orthogonal pairs) in the remaining eight cases in under a day of computing.},\n\
