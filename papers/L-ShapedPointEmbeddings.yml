    \ point set is a planar drawing of the tree where the vertices are mapped to distinct\
    \ points and every edge is drawn as a sequence of two axis-aligned line segments.\
    \ There has been considerable work on establishing upper bounds on the minimum\
    \ cardinality of a point set to guarantee that any tree of the same size with\
    \ maximum degree 4 admits an L-shaped embedding on the point set. However, no\
    \ non-trivial lower bound is known to this date, i.e., no known \\$n\\$-vertex\
    \ tree requires more than \\$n\\$ points to be embedded. In this paper, we present\
    \ the first examples of \\$n\\$-vertex trees for \\$n{\\textbackslash}in{\\textbackslash}\\\
    {13,14,16,17,18,19,20{\\textbackslash}\\}\\$ that require strictly more points\
    \ than vertices to admit an L-shaped embedding. Moreover, using computer help,\
    \ we show that every tree on \\$n{\\textbackslash}leq 12\\$ vertices admits an\
    \ L-shaped embedding in every set of \\$n\\$ points. We also consider embedding\
    \ ordered trees, where the cyclic order of the neighbors of each vertex in the\
    \ embedding is prescribed. For this setting, we determine the smallest non-embeddable\
    \ ordered tree on \\$n=10\\$ vertices, and we show that every ordered tree on\
    \ \\$n{\\textbackslash}leq 9\\$ or \\$n=11\\$ vertices admits an L-shaped embedding\
    \ in every set of \\$n\\$ points. We also construct an infinite family of ordered\
    \ trees which do not always admit an L-shaped embedding, answering a question\
    \ raised by Biedl, Chan, Derka, Jain, and Lubiw.},\n  archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n\
