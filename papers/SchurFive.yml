    \ known as Schur Number Five: What is the largest (natural) number n such that\
    \ there exists a five-coloring of the positive numbers up to n without a monochromatic\
    \ solution of the equation a + b = c? We obtained the solution, n = 160, by encoding\
    \ the problem into propositional logic and applying massively parallel satisfiability\
    \ solving techniques on the resulting formula. We constructed and validated a\
    \ proof of the solution to increase trust in the correctness of the multi-CPU-year\
    \ computations. The proof is two petabytes in size and was certified using a formally\
    \ verified proof checker, demonstrating that any result by satisfiability solvers---no\
    \ matter how large---can now be validated using highly trustworthy systems.},\n\
