    \  abstract = {We present a SAT framework which allows to investigate properties\
    \ of simple drawings of the complete graph \\$K\\_n\\$ using the power of AI.\
    \ In contrast to classic imperative programming, where a program is operated step\
    \ by step, our framework models mathematical questions as Boolean formulas which\
    \ are then solved using modern SAT solvers. Our framework for simple drawings\
    \ is based on a characterization via rotation systems and finite forbidden substructures.\
    \ We showcase its universality by addressing various open problems, reproving\
    \ previous computational results and deriving several new computational results.\
    \ In particular, we test and progress on several unavoidable configurations such\
    \ as variants of Rafla's conjecture on plane Hamiltonian cycles, Harborth's conjecture\
    \ on empty triangles, and crossing families for general simple drawings as well\
    \ as for various subclasses. Moreover, based our computational results we propose\
    \ some new challenging conjectures.},\n  archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n  keywords\
