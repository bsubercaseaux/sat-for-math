    \  abstract = {The classification of mathematical structures plays an important\
    \ role for research in pure mathematics. It is, however, a meticulous task that\
    \ can be aided by using automated techniques. Many automated methods concentrate\
    \ on the quantitative side of classification, like counting isomorphism classes\
    \ for certain structures with given cardinality. In contrast, we have devised\
    \ a bootstrapping algorithm that performs qualitative classification by producing\
    \ classification theorems that describe unique distinguishing properties for isomorphism\
    \ classes. In order to fully verify the classification it is essential to prove\
    \ a range of problems, which can become quite challenging for classical automated\
    \ theorem provers even in the case of relatively small algebraic structures. But\
    \ since the problems are in a finite domain, employing Boolean satisfiability\
    \ solving is possible. In this paper we present the application of satisfiability\
    \ solvers to generate fully verified classification theorems in finite algebra.\
    \ We explore diverse methods to efficiently encode the arising problems both for\
    \ Boolean SAT solvers as well as for solvers with built-in equational theory.\
    \ We give experimental evidence for their effectiveness, which leads to an improvement\
    \ of the overall bootstrapping algorithm.},\n  isbn = {978-1-4020-5571-3},\n \
