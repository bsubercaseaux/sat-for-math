    \ {A fundamental principle of individual rational choice is Sen's \\${\\textbackslash}gamma\\\
    $ axiom, also known as expansion consistency, stating that any alternative chosen\
    \ from each of two menus must be chosen from the union of the menus. Expansion\
    \ consistency can also be formulated in the setting of social choice. In voting\
    \ theory, it states that any candidate chosen from two fields of candidates must\
    \ be chosen from the combined field of candidates. An important special case of\
    \ the axiom is binary expansion consistency, which states that any candidate chosen\
    \ from an initial field of candidates and chosen in a head-to-head match with\
    \ a new candidate must also be chosen when the new candidate is added to the field,\
    \ thereby ruling out spoiler effects. In this paper, we study the tension between\
    \ this weakening of expansion consistency and weakenings of resoluteness, an axiom\
    \ demanding the choice of a single candidate in any election. As is well known,\
    \ resoluteness is inconsistent with basic fairness conditions on social choice,\
    \ namely anonymity and neutrality. Here we prove that even significant weakenings\
    \ of resoluteness, which are consistent with anonymity and neutrality, are inconsistent\
    \ with binary expansion consistency. The proofs make use of SAT solving, with\
    \ the correctness of a SAT encoding formally verified in the Lean Theorem Prover,\
    \ as well as a strategy for generalizing impossibility theorems obtained for special\
    \ types of voting methods (namely majoritarian and pairwise voting methods) to\
    \ impossibility theorems for arbitrary voting methods. This proof strategy may\
    \ be of independent interest for its potential applicability to other impossibility\
    \ theorems in social choice.},\n  archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n  keywords = {Computer\
