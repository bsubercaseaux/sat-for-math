    \ are obtained by leveraging known data structures; the most notable representatives\
    \ are the stack and the queue layouts. In this content, given a data structure,\
    \ one seeks to specify an order of the vertices of the graph and a partition of\
    \ its edges into pages, such that the endpoints of the edges assigned to each\
    \ page can be processed by the given data structure in the underlying order. In\
    \ this paper, we study deque and rique layouts of graphs obtained by leveraging\
    \ the double-ended queue and the restricted-input double-ended queue (or deque\
    \ and rique, for short), respectively. Hence, they generalize both the stack and\
    \ the queue layouts. We focus on complete and complete bipartite graphs and present\
    \ bounds on their deque- and rique-numbers, that is, on the minimum number of\
    \ pages needed by any of these two types of linear layouts.},\n  archiveprefix\
