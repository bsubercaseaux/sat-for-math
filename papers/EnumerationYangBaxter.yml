    \ solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. This equation originates from statistical\
    \ and quantum mechanics, but also has applications in knot theory, cryptography,\
    \ quantum computation and group theory. Non-degenerate, involutive solutions have\
    \ been enumerated for sets up to size 10 using constraint programming with partial\
    \ static symmetry breaking~[1]; for general non-involutive solutions, a similar\
    \ approach was used to enumerate solutions for sets up to size 8. In this paper,\
    \ we use and extend the SAT Modulo Symmetries framework (SMS), to expand the boundaries\
    \ for which solutions are known. The SMS framework relies on a minimality check;\
    \ we present two solutions to this, one that stays close to the original one designed\
    \ for enumerating graphs and a new incremental, SAT-based approach. With our new\
    \ method, we can reproduce previously known results much faster and also report\
    \ on results for sizes that have remained out of reach so far.},\n  isbn = {978-3-031-90653-4}\n\
