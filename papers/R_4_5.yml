    \ Ramsey number R(4,5) is equal to 25. Their proof relies on a combination of\
    \ high-level arguments and computational steps. The authors have performed the\
    \ computational parts of the proof with different implementations in order to\
    \ reduce the possibility of an error in their programs. In this work, we prove\
    \ this theorem in the interactive theorem prover HOL4 limiting the uncertainty\
    \ to the small HOL4 kernel. Instead of verifying their algorithms directly, we\
    \ rely on the HOL4 interface to MiniSat SAT to prove gluing lemmas. To reduce\
    \ the number of such lemmas and thus make the computational part of the proof\
    \ feasible, we implement a generalization algorithm. We verify that its output\
    \ covers all the possible cases by implementing a custom SAT-solver extended with\
    \ a graph isomorphism checker.},\n  archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n  keywords = {Computer\
