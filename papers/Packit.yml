    \ {We present and analyze PackIt!, a turn-based game consisting of packing rectangles\
    \ on an \\$n {\\textbackslash}times n\\$ grid. PackIt! can be easily played on\
    \ paper, either as a competitive two-player game or in {\\textbackslash}emph\\\
    {solitaire\\} fashion. On the \\$t\\$-th turn, a rectangle of area \\$t\\$ or\
    \ \\$t+1\\$ must be placed in the grid. In the two-player format of PackIt! whichever\
    \ player places a rectangle last wins, whereas the goal in the solitaire variant\
    \ is to perfectly pack the \\$n {\\textbackslash}times n\\$ grid. We analyze conditions\
    \ for the existence of a perfect packing over \\$n {\\textbackslash}times n\\\
    $, then present an automated reasoning approach that allows finding perfect games\
    \ of PackIt! up to \\$n = 50\\$ which includes a novel SAT-encoding technique\
    \ of independent interest, and conclude by proving an NP-hardness result.},\n\
