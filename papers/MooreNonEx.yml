      abstract = {Mixed graphs with maximum number of vertices regarding to a given maximum degree and given diameter are known as mixed Moore graphs. In this paper we model the problem of the existence of mixed Moore graphs of diameter 2 through the Boolean satisfiability problem. As a consequence, we prove the non existence of mixed Moore graphs of order 40, 54 and 84.},
