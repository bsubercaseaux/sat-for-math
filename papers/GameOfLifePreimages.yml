    \ {Conway's Game of Life is a two-dimensional cellular automaton. As a dynamical\
    \ system, it is well-known to be computationally universal, i.e. capable of simulating\
    \ an arbitrary Turing machine. We show that in a sense taking a single backwards\
    \ step of the Game of Life is a computationally universal process, by constructing\
    \ patterns whose preimage computation encodes an arbitrary circuit-satisfaction\
    \ problem, or, equivalently, any tiling problem. As a corollary, we obtain for\
    \ example that the set of orphans is coNP-complete, exhibit a 6210{\\texttimes}37800-periodic\
    \ configuration whose preimage is nonempty but contains no periodic configurations,\
    \ and prove that the existence of a preimage for a periodic point is undecidable.\
    \ Our constructions were obtained by a combination of computer searches and manual\
    \ design.},\n  keywords = {cellular automata,computational universality,Conway's\
