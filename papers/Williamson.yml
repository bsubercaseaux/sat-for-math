    \ present for the first time an exhaustive enumeration of Williamson matrices\
    \ of even order n \\&lt; 65. The search method relies on the novel SAT+CAS paradigm\
    \ of coupling SAT solvers with computer algebra systems so as to take advantage\
    \ of the advances made in both the field of satisfiability checking and the field\
    \ of symbolic computation. Additionally, we use a programmatic SAT solver which\
    \ allows conflict clauses to be learned programmatically, through a piece of code\
    \ specifically tailored to the domain area. Prior to our work, Williamson matrices\
    \ had only been enumerated for odd orders n \\&lt; 60, so our work increases the\
    \ bounds that Williamson matrices have been enumerated up to and provides the\
    \ first enumeration of Williamson matrices of even order. Our results show that\
    \ Williamson matrices of even order tend to be much more abundant than those of\
    \ odd orders. In particular, Williamson matrices exist for every even order n\
    \ \\&lt; 65 but do not exist in orders 35, 47, 53, and 59.},\n  copyright = {Copyright\
