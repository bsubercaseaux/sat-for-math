      abstract = {Tournaments are orientations of the complete graph. The directed Ramsey number R(k) is the minimum number of vertices a tournament must have to be guaranteed to contain a transitive subtournament of size k, which we denote by \$\$ TT \_k\$\$. We include a computer-assisted proof of a conjecture by Sanchez-Flores in Graphs Combinatorics 14(2), 181--200 (1998), that all \$\$ TT \_6\$\$-free tournaments on 24 and 25 vertices are subtournaments of \$\$ ST \_\{27\}\$\$, the unique largest \$\$ TT \_6\$\$-free tournament. We also classify all \$\$ TT \_6\$\$-free tournaments on 23 vertices. We use these results, combined with assistance from a SAT solver, to obtain the following improved bounds on R(7): \$\$34 {\textbackslash}le R(7) {\textbackslash}le 47\$\$.},
