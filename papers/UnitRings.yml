      abstract = {The unit conjecture, commonly attributed to Kaplansky, predicts that if \$K\$ is a field and \$G\$ is a torsion-free group, then the only units of the group ring \$K[G]\$ are the trivial units, that is, the non-zero scalar multiples of group elements. We give a concrete counterexample to this conjecture; the group is virtually abelian and the field is order two.},
