      abstract = {In the papers Ziegler(2001) and Goldstein(2012) it was previously shown that any subset of the Boolean cube \$ S {\textbackslash}subset {\textbackslash}\{0,1{\textbackslash}\}{\textasciicircum}n \$ for \$ n {\textbackslash}leq 9 \$ can be partitioned into \$n+1\$ parts of smaller diameter, i.e., the Borsuk conjecture holds for such subsets. In this paper, it is shown that this is also true for \$ n=10 \$; however, the complexity of the computational verification increases significantly. In order to perform the computations in a reasonable time, several heuristics were developed to reduce the search tree. The SAT solver \${\textbackslash}textbf\{kissat\}\$ was used to cut off the search branches.},
