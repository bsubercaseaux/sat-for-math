    \  abstract = {In 1989, computer searches by Lam, Thiel, and Swiercz experimentally\
    \ resolved Lam's problem from projective geometry---the long-standing problem\
    \ of determining if a projective plane of order ten exists.  Both the original\
    \ search and an independent verification in 2011 discovered no such projective\
    \ plane.  However, these searches were each performed using highly specialized\
    \ custom-written code and did not produce nonexistence certificates.  In this\
    \ paper, we resolve Lam's problem by translating the problem into Boolean logic\
    \ and use satisfiability (SAT) solvers to produce nonexistence certificates that\
    \ can be verified by a third party.  Our work uncovered consistency issues in\
    \ both previous searches---highlighting the difficulty of relying on special-purpose\
    \ search code for nonexistence results.},\n  copyright = {Copyright (c) 2021 Association\
