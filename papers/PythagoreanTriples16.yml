    \ been a longstanding open problem in Ramsey Theory: Can the set \\$\\${\\textbackslash}mathbb\
    \ \\{N\\}= {\\textbackslash}\\{1,2,{\\textbackslash}dots {\\textbackslash}\\}\\\
    $\\$of natural numbers be divided into two parts, such that no part contains a\
    \ triple (a,~b,~c) with \\$\\$a{\\textasciicircum}2 + b{\\textasciicircum}2 =\
    \ c{\\textasciicircum}2\\$\\$? A prize for the solution was offered by Ronald\
    \ Graham over two decades ago. We solve this problem, proving in fact the impossibility,\
    \ by using the Cube-and-Conquer paradigm, a hybrid SAT method for hard problems,\
    \ employing both look-ahead and CDCL solvers. An important role is played by dedicated\
    \ look-ahead heuristics, which indeed allowed to solve the problem on a cluster\
    \ with 800 cores in about 2 days. Due to the general interest in this mathematical\
    \ problem, our result requires a formal proof. Exploiting recent progress in unsatisfiability\
    \ proofs of SAT solvers, we produced and verified a proof in the DRAT format,\
    \ which is almost 200 terabytes in size. From this we extracted and made available\
    \ a compressed certificate of 68 gigabytes, that allows anyone to reconstruct\
    \ the DRAT proof for checking.},\n  isbn = {978-3-319-40970-2}\n}\n"
