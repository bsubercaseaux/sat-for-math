  abstract = {We propose a novel SAT-based approach to graph generation. Our approach utilizes the interaction between a CDCL SAT solver and a special symmetry propagator where the SAT solver runs on an encoding of the desired graph property. The symmetry propagator checks partially generated graphs for minimality with respect to a lexicographic ordering during the solving process. This approach has several advantages over a static symmetry breaking: (i) symmetries are detected early in the generation process, (ii) symmetry breaking is seamlessly integrated into the CDCL procedure, and (iii) the propagator performs a complete symmetry breaking without causing a prohibitively large initial encoding. We instantiate our approach by generating extremal graphs with certain restrictions in terms of forbidden subgraphs and diameter. In particular, we could confirm the Murty--Simon Conjecture (1979) on diameter-2-critical graphs for graphs up to 19 vertices and prove the exact number of Ramsey graphs  {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}mathcal\{R\}(3,5,n){\textbackslash})  and  {\textbackslash}({\textbackslash}mathcal\{R\}(4,4,n){\textbackslash}) .},
