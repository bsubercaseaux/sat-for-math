  abstract = {There are many complex combinatorial problems which involve searching for an undirected graph satisfying a certain property. These problems are often highly challenging because of the large number of isomorphic representations of a possible solution. In this paper we introduce novel, effective and compact, symmetry breaking constraints for undirected graph search. While incomplete, these prove highly beneficial in pruning the search for a graph. We illustrate the application of symmetry breaking in graph representation to resolve several open instances in extremal graph theory.},
