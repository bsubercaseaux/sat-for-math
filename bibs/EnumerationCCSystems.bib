  abstract = {Donald Knuth introduced abstract CC systems to represent configurations of points in a plane with a given orientation (clockwise or counterclockwise) of all triples of points. We present efficient enumeration of all non-isomorphic CC systems with at most 12 points. Our algorithm is based on Farad{\v z}ev-Read type enumeration, enhanced with the homomorphism principle and SAT solving, enabling us to enumerate more than 1.3{$\cdot$}1012 non-isomorphic CC systems with 12 points.},
