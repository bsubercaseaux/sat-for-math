  abstract = {The van der Waerden number w ( r; k 1 , k 2 , . . . , k r ) is the least integer m such that for every partition P 1 {$\cup$} P 2 {$\cup$} {$\cdots$} {$\cup$} P r of the set \{1, 2, . . . , m \}, there is an index j in \{1, 2, . . . , r \} such that P j contains an arithmetic progression of k j terms. We have computed exact values of the previously unknown van der Waerden numbers w (2; 3, 17) and w (2; 3, 18).},
