  abstract = {A conjecture originally made by Klein and Szekeres in 1932 (now commonly known as ``Erd{\H o}s--Szekeres'' or ``Happy Ending'' conjecture) claims that for every \$\$m {\textbackslash}ge 3\$\$, every set of \$\$2{\textasciicircum}\{m-2\}+1\$\$points in a general position (none three different points are collinear) contains a convex m-gon. The conjecture has been verified for \$\$m {\textbackslash}le 6\$\$. The case \$\$m=6\$\$was solved by Szekeres and Peters and required a huge computer enumeration that took ``more than 3000 GHz hours''. In this paper we improve the solution in several directions. By changing the problem representation, by employing symmetry-breaking and by using modern SAT solvers, we reduce the proving time to around only a half of an hour on an ordinary PC computer (i.e., our proof requires only around 1~GHz hour). Also, we formalize the proof within the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant, making it significantly more reliable.},
