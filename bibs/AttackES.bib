  abstract = {A classical conjecture of Erd{\H o}s and Szekeres states that, for every integer k{$\geq$}2, every set of 2k-2+1 points in the plane in general position contains k points in convex position. In 2006, Peters and Szekeres introduced the following stronger conjecture: every red-blue coloring of the edges of the ordered complete 3-uniform hypergraph on 2k-2+1 vertices contains an ordered subhypergraph with k vertices and k-2 edges, which is a union of a red monotone path and a blue monotone path that are vertex disjoint except for their two common end-vertices. Applying a state of art SAT solver, we refute the conjecture of Peters and Szekeres. We also apply techniques of Erd{\H o}s, Tuza, and Valtr to refine the Erd{\H o}s--Szekeres conjecture in order to tackle it with SAT solvers.},
