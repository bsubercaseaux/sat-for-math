  abstract = {Proposed for rapid document similarity estimation in web search engines, the celebrated property of minwise independence imposes highly symmetric constraints on a family \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}\$ of permutations of \${\textbackslash}\{1,{\textbackslash}ldots, n{\textbackslash}\}\$: The property is fulfilled by \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}\$ if for each \$j{\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}\{1,{\textbackslash}ldots,n{\textbackslash}\}\$, any cardinality-\$j\$ subset \$X{\textbackslash}subseteq {\textbackslash}\{1,{\textbackslash}ldots,n{\textbackslash}\}\$, and any fixed element \$x{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast{\textbackslash}in X\$, it occurs with probability \$1/j\$ that a randomly drawn permutation \${\textbackslash}pi\$ from \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{F\}\$ satisfies \${\textbackslash}pi(x{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}ast)={\textbackslash}min {\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}pi(x) : x{\textbackslash}in X{\textbackslash}\}\$. The central interest is to find a family with fewest possible members meeting the stated constraints. We provide a framework that, firstly, is realized as a pure SAT model and, secondly, generalizes a heuristic of Mathon and van Trung to the search of these families. Originally, the latter enforces an underlying group-theoretic decomposition to achieve a significant speed-up for the computer-aided search of structures which can be identified with so-called rankwise independent families. We observe that this approach is suitable to find provenly optimal new representatives of minwise independent families while yielding a decisive speed-up, too. As the problem has a naive search space of size at least \$(n!){\textasciicircum}n\$, we also carefully address symmetry breaking. Finally, we add a bijective proof for a problem encountered by Bargachev when deriving a lower bound on the number of members in a minimal rankwise independent family.},
