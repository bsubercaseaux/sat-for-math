  abstract = {In 1988 Rafla conjectured that every simple drawing of a complete graph \$K\_n\$ contains a plane, i.e., non-crossing, Hamiltonian cycle. The conjecture is far from being resolved. The lower bounds for plane paths and plane matchings have recently been raised to \$({\textbackslash}log n){\textasciicircum}\{1-o(1)\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Omega({\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\})\$, respectively. We develop a SAT framework which allows the study of simple drawings of \$K\_n\$. Based on the computational data we conjecture that every simple drawing of \$K\_n\$ contains a plane Hamiltonian subgraph with \$2n-3\$ edges. We prove this strengthening of Rafla's conjecture for convex drawings, a rich subclass of simple drawings. Our computer experiments also led to other new challenging conjectures regarding plane substructures in simple drawings of complete graphs.},
