  abstract = {In a book embedding, the vertices of a graph are placed on the spine of a book and the edges are assigned to pages, so that edges of the same page do not cross. In this paper, we approach the problem of determining whether a graph can be embedded in a book of a certain number of pages from a different perspective: We propose a simple and quite intuitive SAT formulation, which is robust enough to solve non-trivial instances of the problem in reasonable time. As a byproduct, we show a lower bound of 4 on the page number of 1-planar graphs.},
