  abstract = {We present and analyze PackIt!, a turn-based game consisting of packing rectangles on an \$n {\textbackslash}times n\$ grid. PackIt! can be easily played on paper, either as a competitive two-player game or in {\textbackslash}emph\{solitaire\} fashion. On the \$t\$-th turn, a rectangle of area \$t\$ or \$t+1\$ must be placed in the grid. In the two-player format of PackIt! whichever player places a rectangle last wins, whereas the goal in the solitaire variant is to perfectly pack the \$n {\textbackslash}times n\$ grid. We analyze conditions for the existence of a perfect packing over \$n {\textbackslash}times n\$, then present an automated reasoning approach that allows finding perfect games of PackIt! up to \$n = 50\$ which includes a novel SAT-encoding technique of independent interest, and conclude by proving an NP-hardness result.},
