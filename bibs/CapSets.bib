  abstract = {A cap set is a subset of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}\_3{\textasciicircum}n\$ with no solutions to \$x+y+z=0\$ other than when \$x=y=z\$. In this paper, we provide a new lower bound on the size of a maximal cap set. Building on a construction of Edel, we use improved computational methods and new theoretical ideas to show that, for large enough \$n\$, there is always a cap set in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{F\}\_3{\textasciicircum}n\$ of size at least \$2.218{\textasciicircum}n\$.},
