  abstract = {Given a linear equation \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$, the \$k\$-color Rado number \$R\_k({\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\})\$ is the smallest integer \$n\$ such that every \$k\$-coloring of \${\textbackslash}\{1,2,3,{\textbackslash}dots,n{\textbackslash}\}\$ contains a monochromatic solution to \${\textbackslash}mathcal E\$. The degree of regularity of \${\textbackslash}mathcal E\$, denoted \$dor({\textbackslash}mathcal E)\$, is the largest value \$k\$ such that \$R\_k({\textbackslash}mathcal E)\$ is finite. In this article we present new theoretical and computational results about the Rado numbers \$R\_3({\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\})\$ and the degree of regularity of three-variable equations \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{E\}\$. \% We use SAT solvers to compute many new values of the three-color Rado numbers \$R\_3(ax+by+cz = 0)\$ for fixed integers \$a,b,\$ and \$c\$. We also give a SAT-based method to compute infinite families of these numbers. In particular, we show that the value of \$R\_3(x-y = (m-2) z)\$ is equal to \$m{\textasciicircum}3-m{\textasciicircum}2-m-1\$ for \$m{\textbackslash}ge 3\$. This resolves a conjecture of Myers and implies the conjecture that the generalized Schur numbers \$S(m,3) = R\_3(x\_1+x\_2 + {\textbackslash}dots x\_\{m-1\} = x\_m)\$ equal \$m{\textasciicircum}3-m{\textasciicircum}2-m-1\$ for \$m{\textbackslash}ge 3\$. Our SAT solver computations, combined with our new combinatorial results, give improved bounds on \$dor(ax+by = cz)\$ and exact values for \$1{\textbackslash}le a,b,c{\textbackslash}le 5 \$. We also give counterexamples to a conjecture of Golowich.},
